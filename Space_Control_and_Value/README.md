# H1 — Space Control and Value

Implementation of **Hypothesis 1** from the *Contextual Football Scouting* project proposal: a player's quality is measurable by their spatial influence on the pitch, quantified via convex hulls of the opposing block, line-breaker definitions tied to Expected Possession Value (EPV), and the gravity exerted on defenders.

Built on **StatsBomb 360 open data** for UEFA Euro 2024 (`competition_id=55`, `season_id=282`, 51 matches).

The pipeline turns event-level data into a per-player tactical fingerprint built around four composite indices:

- **PROGRESSION** — forward play volume (line-breakers, hull penetrations)
- **DANGEROUSNESS** — threat creation (xT / EPV)
- **RECEPTION** — between-the-lines play and tight-space technique
- **GRAVITY** — spatial pull on the opposing defense

All percentile comparisons are made **within macro-role** (CB / FB / MID / CAM / WIDE / FW), so a centre-back is benchmarked against other centre-backs.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArMat-Analytics/Contextual-Football-Scouting
cd Contextual-Football-Scouting/Space_Control_and_Value
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Open the notebook (recommended)
jupyter notebook notebooks/H1-Space_Control_and_Value.ipynb
```

The notebook runs each stage of the pipeline in order. Each cell calls into `src/`. To run a single stage from the command line (from this folder):

```bash
python -m src.player_totals          
python -m src.hull_metrics           
python -m src.directional_gravity
python -m src.epv_pipeline
python -m src.line_breaker
python -m src.aggregation
```

The intermediate CSVs are committed for the analysis-only path, so you can skip straight to the index design / dashboard cells of the notebook without running the heavy pipelines.

## Conventions

- **Coordinates**: pitch in meters (105 × 68, UEFA standard). StatsBomb yard coordinates are converted via `X_SCALE = 105/120`, `Y_SCALE = 68/80`.
- **Open play**: the EPV step filters out corners, free kicks, throw-ins and kick-offs. Percentage rates downstream use the open-play subset (`passes_op`).
- **Leave-one-out gravity**: each player's gravity is measured against a baseline that **excludes** their own passes, so high-volume players aren't compared against themselves.
- **Within-role percentiles**: every radar axis is the player's percentile rank inside their macro-role.
