              Within the modern transfer market, one of the most significant challenges is the phenomenon of "Team Bias". Clubs frequently overvalue players based on superficial statistical outputs that are often a byproduct of a dominant team structure rather than an accurate reflection of exceptional individual talent. It remains highly difficult to objectively evaluate an athlete without the compounding influence of their respective team's tactical system.

              The primary objective of this project is to shift the analytical paradigm from descriptive to explanatory observations. By incorporating the geometric and spatial context provided by 360-degree data, we evaluate elements often obscured by standard statistics, such as optimal spatial positioning and the quality of a player's decisions relative to the defensive pressure around them. This methodology allows us to determine whether elite performance is a function of individual talent or systemic advantage, providing the optimal approach for uncovering undervalued talent currently operating within less prominent clubs.
