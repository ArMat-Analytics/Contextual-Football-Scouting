"""H2 paths, thresholds, role maps and pitch geometry.

This module is self-contained: H1's relevant constants and helpers are
inlined here (rather than imported from `Space_Control_and_Value/src`)
so H2 can be reorganised under its own `src/` package without import
conflicts. Values are kept identical to H1 — same pitch dimensions, same
pressure radius, same role mapping.
