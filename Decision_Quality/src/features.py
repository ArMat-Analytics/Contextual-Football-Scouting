"""xPass feature engineering — curated set of 12 logical features.

Every feature is computed at t₀ (the freeze frame at the moment the sender
touches the ball). The same routine works for the chosen pass and for any
hypothetical alternative target, so features are directly comparable
between training (real passes) and inference (candidate passes). Each
helper takes the candidate target position explicitly — never reads
`pass.end_location` to avoid leakage of t₁ information.

Each feature carries a clear physical interpretation and an expected sign
(direction in which it pushes P(complete) up or down). The model can find
non-linear interactions between them automatically, but the individual
descriptions below summarise what each one captures by itself.

Feature list — 12 logical features, 13 model columns after one-hot
==================================================================

GEOMETRY OF THE PASS (4)
------------------------
1. pass_distance — meters; Euclidean sender → target.
   Longer passes give defenders more time to react and the ball more
   trajectory uncertainty. Strong negative effect on completion. Typical
   range 3–60 m, median ~13 m in elite football.

2. pass_angle_forward — degrees, 0..180, 0 = directly toward opponent goal.
   Forward passes are harder than lateral or backward ones (smaller
   windows, more committed defending). 0–60° = forward, 60–120° = lateral,
   120–180° = backward. Higher value → easier completion.

3. start_x — meters along the pitch length, sender's x position.
   Proxy for which third of the pitch the action is in. Passes from
   advanced positions (high start_x) face tighter defending in the
   final third, so the sign is mildly negative.

4. target_in_final_third — binary, 1 if target_x ≥ 70 m.
   Discrete companion to start_x focused on the receiver: final-third
   targets attract more pressure. Negative effect on completion.

DEFENDERS BLOCKING THE PASS LINE (3, all continuous)
-----------------------------------------------------
5. min_dist_def_to_receiver — meters; distance from the candidate target
   to the closest opponent at t₀.
   The single most informative signal: a free receiver is much easier to
   hit. Strong positive effect on completion. Range 0.5–25 m typical.

6. min_perp_dist_to_line — meters; smallest perpendicular distance of any
   in-segment opponent to the pass line. Sentinel `20 m` when no defender
   projects onto the segment (open lane).
   Captures whether the *trajectory* itself is contested, independent of
   what is around the receiver. Higher = clearer line. 

7. pass_lane_density_score — dimensionless; inverse-distance-weighted
   "gauntlet" score: `Σ 1 / (perp_dist + 0.5)` over in-segment defenders.
   Smooth complement to the discrete corridor counts: a defender 0.5 m
   off the line contributes 1.0, one 5 m off contributes 0.18, one 10 m
   off contributes 0.10. High score = busy lane → harder pass.

PRESSURE ON THE ACTOR (sender, 2)
---------------------------------
8. sender_pressure_count_25 — integer, opponents within 2.5 m of the
   sender. Same definition as H1's "under pressure" flag.
   Pressure on the passer affects technical execution: rushed passes
   are less accurate. Negative effect on completion.

9. min_dist_def_to_sender — meters; continuous companion to feature 8.
   When sender is alone the value can reach 30 m+; when surrounded it
   falls below 1 m. Higher = freer sender. Positive effect.

LOCAL DENSITY AROUND THE RECEIVER (2)
-------------------------------------
10. defender_density_3m_receiver — integer; opponents within 3 m of the
    candidate target. Captures the immediate crowd: a single defender at
    1.5 m is already disruptive. Negative effect.

11. teammate_density_5m_receiver — integer; teammates within 5 m of the
    target (excluding the candidate target itself).
    Receiver support — tells the model whether the would-be receiver has
    near-by options to lay off if pressed. Mildly positive effect.

PASS TYPE (1 logical, 2 model columns; Ground = baseline)
---------------------------------------------------------
12. pass_height_low / pass_height_high — binary indicators of pass height.
    Both 0 → Ground Pass (the baseline, ~88% of the corpus).
    Lofted passes (Low or High) introduce vertical-trajectory uncertainty
    and make first-touch reception harder. Negative effect for both
    indicators, with `high` typically carrying a stronger negative weight
    than `low` (more time in the air, harder reception).

Audit notes — features computed but excluded from FEATURE_COLS
==============================================================
* `defenders_in_corridor_5m`, `defenders_in_corridor_2m` — integer counts
  of defenders inside a hard-threshold band along the pass line.
  Redundant with the continuous `min_perp_dist_to_line` and
  `pass_lane_density_score`.
* `receiver_pressure_count_25` — redundant with `min_dist_def_to_receiver`
  in 95 % of the corpus (it is essentially a binary indicator that the min
  distance is below 2.5 m); logit coefficient = 0.005, pure noise.
* `pass_height_ground` — dropped to remove the perfect collinearity of
  three indicators that always sum to 1. Ground Pass is the implicit
  baseline; the remaining two indicators read as "Low / High vs Ground".

These four diagnostic columns are still computed and kept on the corpus
DataFrame for segmentation and inspection — they just do not feed the
model.

Geometry primitives (`count_bypassed`, `count_opponents_within`) live in
the local `src.geometry` module — they mirror H1's line-breaker primitives
to keep the definition of pressure (radius 2.5 m, threshold 2 opponents)
identical across the two projects.
